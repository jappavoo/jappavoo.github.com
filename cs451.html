"A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system." [Tanenbaum and Steen 2006]. Every major internet service is a distributed system. Examples include Google, Facebook, Youtube, banking websites and for that matter the World Wide Web itself. Other fundamental services such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Domain Name Services (DNS) and email are also distributed systems. For students to be effective, today and in the future, as decision makers, technical advisors, innovators and implementors they should be familiar with the principles and paradigms that underlying this important class of systems.</p>

<b>Welcome! Here's to a fun term hacking!</b>
This year we have completely revamping the course and modeling it after
the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/">MIT 6.824</a>. 
We will be learning right along with you.  It should be a fun term
where we will read some papers together and write some go code!

<hr>
Please use <a href="http://piazza.com/bu/fall2018/cascs451651/home">Piazza</a>
to read announcements and discuss labs, lectures and papers.
We will look at Piazza regularly and answer
questions (unless one of you answers first);
the entire class can see and benefit from these exchanges.

<h1><a name="desc">Course Description</a></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
CS451/651 (Distributed Systems) is a fast-paced, broad and practical
introduction to the fundamentals of distributed systems.
The class will be taught in the style of a graduate course and requires the reading
research papers and independent exploration of the material.  The class will include  
lectures, readings, programming labs, a mid-term exam, and a final exam.
It will present abstractions and implementation
techniques for engineering distributed systems. Major topics include
fault tolerance, replication, and consistency. Much of the class
consists of studying and discussing case studies of distributed
systems.

<p><b>
This version of the course draws heavily from <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/">MIT 6.824</a>.  This class owes most of it contents to  Robert Morris,  Frans Kaashoek and Nickolai Zeldovich who developed much of the 6.824 course material. It is with great admiration and thanks that we are using it.
</b>

<h2>Formal Description</h2>
<p>
Programming-centric introduction to how networks of computers are
structured to operate as coherent single system. Introducing
principles of architecture, processes, communications, naming,
synchronization, consistency and replication, fault tolerance and
security, and paradigms such as web-based, object-based, file systems,
and coordination-based. 


<hr>

<h1><a name="prereq">Prerequisites</a></h1>
<p>
The prerequisites for this course are CS 112, CS 210 Computer Systems.
It is also helpful if you have taken one or both of CS 455 and CS 452.
Substantial programming experience will be helpful for the
lab assignments. Students without the prerequisites will not be allowed to enroll in the course. If you you are unsure about your preperation please see the instructor.
</p>
 
<hr>
<h1><a name="grade">Grade Breakdown</a></h1>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Your final grade will be determined approximately as follows:
</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#000000"
 style="background-color:#FFFFFF" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
<tr>
  <td>

<tr>
  <td>
    Mid-term and Final

  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

  </td>
  <td>
    15%
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<hr>
<h1><a name="labs">Programming Labs</a></h1>
<p>
You must write all the code you hand in for the programming labs, except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution (and you're not allowed to look at solutions from previous years). You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use each other's code.

Please do not publish your code or make it available to current or future students. github.com repositories are public by default, so please don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. 

You may discuss the paper questions with other students, but you may not look at other students' answers. You must write your answers yourself.

<hr>
<h1><a name="structure">Weekly Class Structure and Evaluation</a></h1>
<p>

<p> Most class
meetings will be part lecture and part paper discussion.  You
should read the paper <i>before</i> coming to class, and be prepared
to discuss it. You can find out what paper to read for each meeting in
the <a href="451/schedule.html">schedule</a>.

<p>
We will post a question about each paper 24 hours before
the beginning of class.
Your answer need only be long enough to demonstrate that
you understand the paper; a paragraph or two will usually be enough.
We won't give feedback, but we will glance at your answers to make
sure they make sense, and they will count for part of the
paper discussion grade.

<p>Will have an exam during class in the middle
  of the term, and a final exam during finals week.

<p>There are programming labs due every week or two throughout the term.

<hr>
<h1><a name="project">Workload</a></h1>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Be forewarned the workload in this course will be heavy. To master
the conceptual material covered in the lecture and prepare you for
completion of the labs there will be required weekly research papers to 
read and programming required outside of class time.</p>

<h2>
<h1><a name="651">CS651</a></h1>

Graduate students will be required to either do the 4th assignment or a final project with an associated report and presentation.
See the <a href="451/project.html">Project Page</a> for more details.  Projects must be done in groups of 3-4 students.

<h1><a name="texts">TextBooks</a></h1>
<p><b>There is not required text for this class</b>

<p> You may find this book useful to get an overview of various topics
that we will be covering in the research papers we read.

<h1><a name="honesty">Academic Honesty</a></h1>

<p>
Assignments must be completed individually. Discussion of issues in
computer systems is encouraged, but representing the work of another
person as your own is expressly forbidden. This includes "borrowing",
"stealing", copying programs/solutions or parts of them from
others. We may use an automated plagiarism checker. Cheating will not
be tolerated under any circumstances. Handing in your own work a day
or two late will affect your grade far less than turning in a copy of
someone else's work on time!

<p>
See the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cas/students/undergrad-resources/code/">CAS
Academic Conduct Code</a>, in particular regarding plagiarism and
cheating on exams. Copies of the CAS Academic Conduct Code are also
available in room CAS 105. A student suspected to violate this code
will be reported to the Academic Conduct Committee, and if found
culpable, the student will receive a grade of "F" for the course.
