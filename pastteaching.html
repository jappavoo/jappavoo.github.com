	<p><b></br>CAS CS 591 : Special Topics : Cloud Computing
	Seminar Fall 2009</b></br>
	This is an interactive seminar course exploring Cloud
	Computing, including its definition, history, and realization
	from a computer science perspective.   We will focus on
	systems related topics, including production and transmission
	of computational capacity, physical and virtual consolidation,
	centralized and distributed ownership, costs, metering, usage
	models, impact on software development, and efficiency.  We
	will also touch upon the technical aspects of the attendant
	socioeconomic issues, raised by Cloud Computing, that were
	identified by the early computer scientists who pioneered
	these ideas.    The course will require the reading, review
	and critique of literature from various sources, predominately
	drawn from systems related research literature.   Projects and
	Presentations will give students the opportunity to explore
	one or more of the topics discussed in class in a hands-on
	fashion.  <br>
	<u>Prerequisites:</u> The course is open to advanced
	undergraduates and graduate students who are comfortable
	reading academic literature.  Students should have taken 350,
	330 (or equivalents) and be comfortable with operating system
	and networking topics.  Exceptions will be made at the
	discretion of the instructor.<br>
	WARNING: Implementation
	based projects may require considerable “on the job training”
	and affinity for hacking.<br>
	Time : Fridays  10:00am -1:00pm	Location :  MCS 137 <div style="text-align: right;"> <a href="http://www.cs.bu.edu/~jappavoo/Home/Cloud_Computing_Seminar_Fall_2009.html">Course Web Page</a></div></b></p>

	<p><b>CAS CS 553 : Advanced Operating Systems Spring 2010</b></br>
	During this hands-on course small teams of 2-3 students will
	design and build their own little multi-server operating systems
	on top of the L4Ka::Pistachio microkernel. The goal is to gain
	practical experience in applying the theory of operating systems
	to the design and implementation of a consistent and functioning
	set of operating system services that manage and abstract the
	hardware resources and provide a base system on which a robust
	user environment can be developed. The lectures focus on different
	"building blocks" of operating systems such as: communication,
	multi-tasking/-processing, virtual memory management, and file
	services. Examples and case-studies found in contemporary
	operating systems are included.  A major component of the course
	is the class project. The project gives the students the
	opportunity to design (and later implement in teams), their own
	little multi-sever operating system on top of the L4Ka::Pistachio
	microkernel.  After the build environment, tools, and example code
	is presented, we focus on incorporating the building blocks from
	the lectures into our to-be-designed OS.  Each student (or team,
	depending on enrollment) will present their own design ideas for
	one particular aspect.  Expect several hours of work per week in
	order to produce a functioning implementation of the OS by the end
	of the course.  There is no required text for the
	course.<br>
	<u>Prerequisites:</u> A good understanding of OS concepts from CS
	552 Operating Systems or equivalent.  During the course you will
	be required to read and write C or C++ code. Basic programming
	skills in C will do; C++ is fine, however, the programming and
	debugging load will be high. <br>
	Time : Tuesdays and Thursdays 3:30-5:00 Loc: GCB 208 <div style="text-align: right;"> <a href="http://www.cs.bu.edu/~jappavoo/Home/Advanced_OS.html">Course Web Page</a></div></b></p>

	  <p><b>CAS CS 451/651 :  Distributed Systems Spring 2012</b><br>
	  Distributed Systems is a fast-paced, broad and practical
      introduction to the fundamentals of distributed systems. The
      course first examines foudational topics such as: System Models,
      Networking, Interprocess Communications, Remote Invocation,
      Indirect Communications, and Operating Systems Support.  After
      covering the foundations a selection of topics will be covered
      from: Distributed algorithms, Shared data,Middleware, System
      services. A major goal of the course is to provide practical
      exposure to distributed systems through a term long programming
      project in which small groups of students construct a
      distributed game using 'C'.  The project requires significant
      programming effort. <br><u>Prerequisites:</u>  CS112  and CS210
      <br>WARNING: Programming assignments and projects may require
      considerable "on the job training" and affinity for hacking. <br>
